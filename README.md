# What is Juno?
This is a place to store interesting things and to build a public online persona. Having a personal website is a small step, but will allow me to create content a put it out into the world.

# What is the Roadmap?
* Create an *About* section that lays a baseline for who I am and why I'm doing this
* Create a *Books* list that keeps track of what I read each year
  * May include a small section for thoughts, but I may save all that for somewhere else
* Create a *Blog* where I can share thoughts and ideas
  * This will primarily house ideas around technology and startups, but may veture into sports, books, public policy, travel, or anything else I put thoughts together around
* Finally there will be a contact section, with information about how to contact me
  * While I don't anticipate this becoming a high traffic site with lots of followers, creating a small number of meaningful relationships with people is **not** unrealistic
