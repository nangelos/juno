# What is Juno?

This is a place to store interesting things and to build a public online persona. Having a personal website is a small step, but will allow me to create content a put it out into the world.

# What is the Roadmap?

- Create an _About_ section that lays a baseline for who I am and why I'm doing this
- Create a _Books_ list that keeps track of what I read each year
  - May include a small section for thoughts, but I may save all that for somewhere else
  - May add a _Books to Read_ section to keep track of what I hope to read in the future
- Create a _Blog_ where I can share thoughts and ideas
  - This will primarily house ideas around technology and startups, but may veture into sports, books, public policy, travel, or anything else where I put thoughts together
- Finally there will be a _Contact_ section, with information about how to contact me
  - While I don't anticipate this becoming a high traffic site with lots of followers, creating a small number of meaningful relationships with people is **not** unrealistic
