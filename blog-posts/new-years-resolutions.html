            Why I Don't Make New Year's Resolutions
          </h1>
          <p>
            Every January, people around the world set goals for the new year, resolving to eat healthier, exercise more frequently,
            develop new skills, hit a financial goal, or expand their horizons in some other way. All of these can be admirable
            goals - there’s nothing wrong with a little self improvement - but New Year’s Resolutions are virtually always based on
            a flawed premise: that something has meaningfully changed between December 31st and January 1st. To put it bluntly,
            nothing has changed. The change from one year to another is arbitrary. There is no magic in it, and perhaps more
            importantly there’s no science in it. If February were the first month of the year it would make very little difference
            in how people live their lives, or their ability to set and accomplish goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            When people eat too much and exercise too little from late November through the end of the year, blaming it on parties,
            travel, and holiday traditions, they’re not exactly wrong. But if you haven’t been to the gym since last February, you
            can’t (with any measure of seriousness) blame that on end of year festivities. If your 65-day Duo Lingo streak was
            broken six months ago… Well, you get the point. The problem with trying to do better or improve ourselves isn’t that
            we’re incapable, it’s that we can’t count on an external event (particularly one as meaningless as the change of the
            calendar) to shock us out of our current habits. I know this because for years I came into every January with high hopes
            about all the changes I was going to make, only to find that by early February (if not sooner!) I had already fallen
            short. Filled with disappointment and feeling like a failure, I would try my best to forget about my New Year’s
            Resolutions and carry on with life as I knew it - comfortable, complacent, with minimal risk of failure because I was no
            longer looking to make changes or achieve anything that would stretch me outside my comfort zone.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point you could be forgiven for thinking this sounds like a depressing monologue with the take away message of,
            “Don’t set goals because you won’t achieve them.” If you stopped reading now, you might be right. However, as I’ve
            gotten older I’ve realized that change is both easier and harder than it was when I was young. Harder because as you
            become more stuck in your ways it seems to requires more of a push to get out of your comfortable rut, but easier
            because I came to realize that there’s no better time to make a change than today.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s easy to say, “I’ll start that diet on Monday,” but much harder to actually start eating more vegetables when Monday
            rolls around after eating junk food all weekend. I’ve found it’s much easier to go to the store, buy some vegetables,
            and make them a part of your next meal rather than making it part of a (somewhat ambiguous) future plan. By doing
            something now, you decrease the inertia needed to make a change later - simply because there’s less “bad habit mass”
            built up from the extra days of not pursuing the change. So step one to making more effective change is starting now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, it’s easier on my psyche to look back over the past week and realize I didn’t go to the gym at all and say,
            “I need to do better, I need to exercise tomorrow,” than it is to look back at the end of December and say, “Wow, I
            really failed on that gym goal. I haven’t been in six months!” By checking in on your goals frequently, you can get
            yourself back on track much more quickly. It takes a bit of effort to remember to review them, but over time it’s become
            normal for me to check in weekly (or even daily) on goals. I’ve also found myself inadvertently setting shorter goals
            (exercise 3x per week) instead of bigger goals that set myself up for a larger failure if I don’t keep up (go to the gym
            100x this year). Similarly, setting more realistic goals is easier when I’m accounting for things I know I have to
            manage during the week ahead (sickness, appointments, travel, or longer expected work days) instead of projecting
            further into the future. So step two is to check in on goals frequently.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final step that has helped me achieve more goals is to amend them as appropriate. The world is changing so quickly
            that what seems critically important today might be forgotten by next week, relegated only to our memories before
            eventually being forgotten entirely. Incidentally, this is what makes consumer goods (including consumer-facing tech
            products) such difficult businesses - trends are exceptionally hard to predict, and even harder to sustain. History is
            littered with examples where billions of dollars have been spent on ideas that didn’t pan out, but few things are
            lionized more than the founders who started out doing one thing only to pivot to something else once they received more
            information from the market. If this constant iteration and feedback loop is so crucial in the business world, doesn’t
            it stand to reason that we should regularly reassess whether or not our individual goals make sense as well? If you find
            your goals are no longer relevant, adjust them so they are. If you realize five goals turned out to be too much change
            all at once, choose one or two and focus your efforts there. Succeeding at two things always feels better than failing
            at five, even if you’re a perfectionist.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this all sounds a bit too good to be true, it’s because it is. Even when you resolve to start now, check in
            regularly, and update your goals as appropriate you’re still going to mess up. You will not achieve every goal. Guess
            what, that’s ok! Give yourself some grace because you were probably set up to fail from the outset, and remember that
            all the learning and growth comes from the journey, not from the destination. There’s no shame in trying and failing,
            and there’s no better time than today to try again. So next time you’re thinking about your New Year’s resolutions,
            possibly even thinking about how you have fallen short, consider setting a resolution for the new week, or even a new
            day. Years are made up of days and weeks; use those intervals to map out your progress and achieve your goals.
