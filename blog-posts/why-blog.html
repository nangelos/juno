             Why I Decided to Build a Blog and a Website
           </h1>
          <p>
            The last few years have been a whirlwind as I've started a company, applied to business schools, moved across the country, recruited for internships, and ultimately hearing those sweet words that every MBA student dreams of, "We'd like to bring you back next year." Everyting moved so fast that it's hard to remember all the details. I find myself telling people what a blur it was and how every waking hour was spent in class, studying, or recruiting, and then when I finally thought I would have a chance to relax COVID-19 hit, shutting down everything and turning the last several months into an endless string of days where I am rarely sure which day of the week it actually is. This blog will be an attempt to document things as they happen and put some of my thoughts and ideas out into the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why build an entire website? Why not use Medium or Blogspot or some other platform and save myself the trouble? Part of it was just wanting to write some code. My summer internship kept me pretty busy, so if you see that gaping hole of GitHub commits during the summer of 2020, that's why. I like writing code for new projects, and creating a personal website seemed like an interesting project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part is wanting to have more than just a blog. A website can be a way to keep track of books I want to read and books I have read. It can serve as a way to store interesting links in case I am browsing on a computer without my bookmarks. It can be a place to link to my projects, social media posts, or notes about things I'm reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I want more control over my content. If I self-publish, nobody else is going to take down my posts, vacuum up data from readers, or monetize my intellectual property without giving me a cent. While I don't have any illusions about becoming someone with a lucrative audience that advertisers would pay to reach, it only seems fair that if anyone is going to make money off my content, it should be me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control over content is about more than just blog posts though. It's about customizing the look and feel of my site. I was once asked to create a website for an organization that would live on beyond my involvement. I took a day and put together something that was all HTML and CSS without a single line of JavaScript. I used hash navigation so it was only one index.html file to update. They would need to change some images from time to time, so I created a folder to drop new images in and told them I would be happy to show the next person how to update things in 5 minutes or less. I told them I would deploy on GitHub pages and it would cost them nothing. Instead they decided to spend hundreds of dollars a year to use a drag and drop solution because it would be "easier to hand off."
          </p>
          <p>
            I told them the next person in charge of tech should probably know something about writing basic code and might even use this as a resume booster, but their minds were made up. They did what they thought was best, but it wasn't worth my time to figure out a no-code solution to something I could already do (in fact had already done) with code and could customize to a far greater degree.
