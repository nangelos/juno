             Why I Decided to Build a Blog and a Website
           </h1>
          <p>
            The last few years have been a whirlwind as I started a company, applied to business schools, moved across the country, recruited for internships, and ultimately heard those sweet words that every MBA student dreams of, "We'd like to bring you back next year." Everyting moved so fast that it's hard to remember all the details. I find myself telling people what a blur the first year of business school was, how every waking hour was spent in class, studying, or recruiting, and then when I finally thought I would have a chance to relax, COVID-19 hit shutting everything down and turning the last six months into an endless string of days where I am often unsure which day of the week it is. This blog will be an attempt to document things as they happen and put some of my thoughts and ideas out into the world. I expect I'll write primarily about buiness school, technology, and startups, but like all living things it could change over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why build an entire website? Why not use Medium or Blogspot or some other platform and save myself the trouble? Part of it was just wanting to write some code. My summer internship kept me pretty busy, so if you see that gaping hole of GitHub commits during the summer of 2020, that's why. I like writing code for new projects, and creating a personal website seemed like an interesting project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part is wanting to have more than just a blog. A website can be a way to keep track of books I want to read and books I have read. It can serve as a place to store interesting links in case I am using a computer without my bookmarks. It can be a place to link to my projects, social media posts (which are admittedly rare), or notes about things I'm reading. A personal website can be anything I want it to be, and I want it to be more than a blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I want control over my content. If I do this myself, nobody is going to take down my posts, vacuum up data from readers, or monetize my intellectual property without giving me a cent. While I don't have any illusions about gaining a lucrative audience that advertisers would pay to reach, it only seems fair that if anyone is going to make money off my content, it should be me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control over content is about more than just blog posts though. It's about customizing the look and feel of my site. I was once asked to create a website that would live on beyond my involvement for an organization. I took a day and put together something that was all HTML and CSS without a single line of JavaScript. I used hash navigation so everything was contained in one <span class="code">index.html</span> file. They would need to change some images from time to time, so I created a folder to drop new images in and told them I would be happy to show the next person how to make quick updates. I was planning to use GitHub Pages for hosting and it would cost them absolutely nothing, but instead they decided to spend hundreds of dollars a year to use a drag and drop solution because it would be, "easier to hand off."
          </p>
          <p>
            I argued that the person in charge of "tech" should probably be capable of editing basic HTML, but their minds were made up. My experience with no-code website builders is that they are brittle and are much harder to tweak than inspecting an element and changing the CSS, so my involvement ended at that point. Last I knew they still hadn't purchased a doman or put up a website, so clearly it was not a priority, but this was just one more example of how involving non-technical people in even the most basic technical decisions can be frustrating. That, however, is a story for another day.
