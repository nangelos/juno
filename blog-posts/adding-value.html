            Can I Even Add Any Value to a Startup?
          </h1>
          <p>
            If you’re like me, you love startups. You love the energy, the feeling of doing something new or better, the big dreams, and the sheer amount of work that needs to be done because there is so little structure. Maybe you want to work at a startup but don’t feel like you have the necessary skill level. You might ask yourself, “What value can I even add?” You might be surprised.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the fall semester of my second year in business school, I came across an opportunity to work with a startup from New York. They needed help building a financial model and a slide deck for investors, and while I was far from an expert, I had just spent the summer doing exactly those things as a summer associate at an investment bank. With that being said, it was a CPG company, which is not particularly sexy, and I had a lot going on with course work, and advising First Year students recruiting for banking, so I decided not to pursue the opportunity. A few days later I had a change of heart and reached out to one of the co-founders to offer my help. I received a reply that they had already partnered with another student (a first year MBA if you can believe that!) to build their model and deck, but they might have additional work if I was interested. I wasn’t sure what they might need, and wasn’t even sure what value I could add since Excel and PowerPoint duties had already been assigned, but I set up a time for a video chat and went to work trying to learn what I could about the company and the founders using my Google-fu skills.
<p>
    A few days later I met one of the co-founders (virtually of course, this was in the midst of a global pandemic), an industrial designer turned entrepreneur with a good feel for the product and the market, but not much experience with the business aspect of running a business. We discussed what the prior student had done and then she asked if I could put together some ideas about potential exits at some point down the road. The company was in the process of fundraising and she wanted to have data to back up why this was a viable investment for venture firms. I agreed and she sent a two-week work agreement that spelled out what I would do and how I would be compensated. I would receive no money or equity (who would give up equity for two weeks of work?), but I could list myself as a consultant for the company on my resume and LinkedIn. I was doing it for the experience and because I wanted to be involved with a startup, and while I wouldn’t go so far as to say I would have paid them to do the work, compensation was a non-issue.
</p>
<p>
    I started by going through everything they had, including the previous MBA student’s work, and then dug in to see what I could find in terms of potential exits in the space. The founders understood the health and beauty space and the potential for exits there, but they wanted additional information as it related to kid’s brands. Unsurprisingly there was not a ton of information available for free, but a few hours of research turned into some helpful information. Ultimately, I pivoted a bit and put together a presentation that outlined their options generally, and who the relevant players might be. At this point they were closing on a seed round, and since they had talked about an exit 5+ years in the future I put together a slide deck that talked about growth equity, an acquisition, and threw in a traditional LBO (private equity acquisition). I talked about a few relevant deals and gave them names of specific firms and funds who were active in their space and closed by talking about how the most important thing was not valuation but instead finding the right partner.
</p>
<p>
    As someone who is interested in finance and had to do a lot of research just to be able to speak coherently during Investment Banking recruiting much of the information was basically second nature to me, but nearly everything I presented was entirely new to the founders. I’m not an expert, but they appreciated my work and asked clarifying questions about anything they did not understand, or I didn’t explain clearly enough. They walked away with an increased understanding of what their options might look like down the road, with the associated pros and cons.
</p>


<p>
    I also updated their financial model. It was difficult to follow, so I consolidated some of the information, added explanatory text where necessary, reformatted it, and provided a key to explain the formatting. It might sound like a small thing, but models can be hard to work your way through a week or two after you build it. It can be almost impossible to find things in someone else’s model. A few conventions and explainers are gifts to future users, and as a founder the last thing you want to be doing is stumbling through a model during a pitch or having a potential investor stumble through it.
</p>

    You might think you don’t know enough to work at a startup. Aren’t startups full of a bunch of geniuses? Why would they ever want your help? In some ways it’s true that it can be hard to get a job at a high-flying, well-funded startup, but in many ways it’s just the opposite. Startups might be the most forgiving of your inexperience because they just need help. Chances are you have a skill that can be valuable to a startup, especially if you are just looking for experience. Nobody turns down free help.
