             When I Made the Switch to Linux
           </h1>
          <p>
            One week ago my MacBook Pro crashed, just in time for the new semester of school to start. The good news was that my MacBook was from mid-2012, one of the last ones that you can actually open up and switch out your HDD for an SSD. I upgraded to an SSD a few months ago, so I have a fairly recent copy of my hard drive on the HDD. The bad news was that none of the easy fixes for that stupid folder with a question mark on startup worked, and I didn't really have time to mess with it since classes were starting. This meant that I was stuck with just my PC, and I was not about to start coding on Windows; I just wasn't. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter Linux. My PC has way more space than I need, so I created a new partition, found an empty flash drive, downloaded Manjaro Linux, and made my flash drive bootable. So far so good. I restarted my computer, pressed F12, and waited for the boot menu to appear. When it did I was able to boot from the flash drive and click through an install wizard to put Manjaro on my empty partition, and just like that I had a new operating system on my PC. I have to confess I almost felt like a real software engineer, and I still get a little bit excited whenever I turn on my computer and have to decide whether to boot up Manjaro or Windows. Do I want to be a business person, or a tech guy? It's sort of like a digital mullet, business in the front, party in the back!

            Now that I had Linux and was feeling like a boss, it was time to install all the software I need to write some code. Step 1: install VS Code. I know, I know, real developers use Vim or Emacs. What can I say, I only dream of being a real dev one day. I do a google search, go to the downloads page, click the Linux version, and ... get an error: <span class="code">Cannot find fake root binary</span>. Try again, same error, which I guess means omething about my computer doesn't know how to open the .exe file to install VS Code? These are not MacOS or Windows problems, so I've never really dealt with a computer that doesn't know how to install downloaded software. So new Step 1: install Skype so I can screenshare with my best friend who actually knows what the heck he's doing and can walk me through this. Same process as before (but for Skype), same error. In fact no matter what I try to download, nothing can install.

              So I decide to put my Google fu to the test, which tells me this is a pacman issue, whatever that means. As it turns out pacman is short for package manager, and all my problems will be solved by running <span class="code">install sudo pacman -S base-devel</span> in my command line. Cool, execpt I try and get a new error, which I Google and see a suggestion to try <span class="code">sudo pacman-mirrors -g</span> in my terminal, which actually works! Next step is to run <span class="code">pacman -Syyu</span> after which I can finally download this guy <a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay" target="_blank">https://github.com/Jguer/yay</a> which, if I can follow the directions, will (allegedy) allow me to install software on my Linux machine. To my surprise, it WORKED! Next command: <span class="code">yay -S skype</span> to install Skype, and finally I'm out of the weeds. Well, sort of. At least now I can get the help I need from my guy <a href="https://github.com/jamestthompson3">Taylor Thompson</a>.

            While I have a start on this new Linux machine, what I've learned very quickly is that you can do a lot of customization. The actual OS is tiny, which means it's lighting fast and doesn't come with a bunch of pre-installed garbage I will never use. It also means the UI is a little bit ugly, especially the mouse icons, so I'm working on that. While I'm not ready to say I will develop on Linux for the rest of my life, I will say I've really enjoyed it so far and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
